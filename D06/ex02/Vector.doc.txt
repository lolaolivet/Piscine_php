<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles vectors that are instance of the Vertex class.

An instance can be constructed from a destination that is obligatory and that
contains an x, y, z and optionaly w, and an origin based on the same content.
new Vector( array( 'dest' => new (Vertex array('x' => 0.0, 'y' => 0.0, 'z' => 0.0,
 'w' => 1.0, 'color' => 0xffffff ) ) ) );

The class provides the following methods :

Float   magnitude( );
Calculate the magnitude of a vector.

Vector  normalize( );
Return a normalized vector.

Vector  add( Vector $rhs );
Return the vector product of the addition of two vectors.

Vector  sub( Vector $rhs );
Return the vector difference of substitution of two vectors.

Vector  opposition( );
Return the vector opposite.

Vector  scalarProduct( $k );
Calculate the scalar product of a vector.

Float   dotProduct( Vector $rhs );
Calculate the dot Product of two vectors;

Float   cos( Vector $rhs );
Calculate the cos of the angle between two vectors.

Vector  crossProduct( Vector $rhs );
Calculate the vector resulting of a cross product between two vectors.
